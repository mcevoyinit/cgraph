CGraph was born out of an attempt to answer many questions we ask ourselves when building on Corda. 
These questions can be divided into three categories..

## Reading
 - What is the optimum read model for Corda? 
 - How we get data out of the node to where it needs to be efficiently and at scale? 
 - How can we skip unnecessary steps when retrieving and viewing data?

## Modelling
 - How do we model the overall domain of data in Corda systems? 
 - How do we unify on-ledger (state data) and off-ledger data to be queried flexibly and uniformly across the full domain of data in Corda-based systems? 
 - How can relationships be more easily modelled? 
 - How can data be traversed, extended, and developed against in the most pain-free way while maintaining compatibility with past and future versions of Corda? 
 - How can we best prepare to monetize our golden sources of data?

## Productivity
 - How can we enable stronger cross-team collaboration around the product and data model? 
 - How can test engineers, business analysts, product owners, data engineers, and cordapp developers align further and collaborate more closely on their product and data model?
