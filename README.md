# CGraph - Corda & The Graph

CGraph is a simple connector library that allows you to pipe verified data from Corda into a GraphQL server and database, over HTTP. 

This means you can transact across trust boundaries, with Corda for safe, secure and provable data but also,
 read via GraphQL for federation, flexibility, and more.
